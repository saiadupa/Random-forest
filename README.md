Overview
This project showcases the implementation of a Random Forest model for image classification using the Fashion MNIST dataset. The dataset comprises 4 classes with 10 images each for training, and a 5th class for testing the model.

Requirements
Python 3.x
pandas
scikit-learn
Results
The model attains an accuracy of 86% on both the validation and test datasets.

Additional Features
Hyperparameter Tuning
The script includes a grid search for hyperparameter tuning, optimizing the number of estimators and minimum samples leaf.

Clustering
Integration of K-means clustering as a feature enhances the model with additional information.

Cross-Validation
A 5-fold cross-validation assesses the consistency of the final model.
