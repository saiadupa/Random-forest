#Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of a Random Forest model for image classification using the Fashion MNIST dataset. The dataset consists of 4 classes, each containing a set of 10 images for training, and a final 5th class used for testing the model.

#Requirements
Python 3.x
pandas
scikit-learn

#Results
The model achieves an accuracy of 86% on both the validation and test datasets.

#Additional Features
##Hyperparameter Tuning
The script includes a grid search for hyperparameter tuning, optimizing the number of estimators and minimum samples leaf.
##Clustering
The script demonstrates the integration of K-means clustering as a feature, enhancing the model with additional information.
##Cross-Validation
A 5-fold cross-validation is performed to assess the consistency of the final model.
